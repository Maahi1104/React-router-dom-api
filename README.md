# React-router-dom-api

Installation using npm:

$ npm install --save react-router-dom

Then with a module bundler like webpack, use as you would anything else:

// using ES6 modules
import { BrowserRouter, Route, Link } from "react-router-dom";

// using CommonJS modules
const BrowserRouter = require("react-router-dom").BrowserRouter;
const Route = require("react-router-dom").Route;
const Link = require("react-router-dom").Link;

The UMD build is also available on unpkg:

<script src="https://unpkg.com/react-router-dom/umd/react-router-dom.min.js" > </script>
